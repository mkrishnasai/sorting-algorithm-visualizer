# sorting-algorithm-visualizer

It's easy when we learn by visualizing the things when compared to reading in books and memorizing. With the help of this project even a naive person can understand the sorting algorithm easily. It has controls rather than auto execution, so that the learner can understand step by step execution process. In this project for now I implemented only one sorting algorithm i.., 'selection sort'.
